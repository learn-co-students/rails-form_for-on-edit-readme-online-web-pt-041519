form_tag: allows us to automatically generate HTML form code and integrate data to both auto fill the values as well as have the form submit data that 
   the controller can use to either create or update a record in the database.

   Passes in:
      1. the route where the parameters for the form will be sent
      2. the http method that the form will utilize
      3. the attributes for each field

   
Best practices:
Use form_for when your form is directly connected to a model. 
Extending our example from the introduction, this would be our Hamster's profile edit form that 
connects to the profile database table. This is the most common case when form_for is used

Use form_tag when you simply need an HTML form generated. 
Examples of this would be: a search form field or a contact form
